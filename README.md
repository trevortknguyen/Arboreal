# Arboreal

This project has some sort of future. It has a vision, just like every other project on GitHub. Yet, like many of the projects on GitHub specifically the LWJGL Java projects on GitHub, this is based on a tutorial and does not actually have any real content yet. I should also mention that it is not playable in any sense yet.

I am still trying to understand what the best way to configure a project like this is. I'm using Eclipse as my IDE, which handles most of the things for me, but it's to my understanding that other people use something more universal like Maven on Gradle in order to allow others to build the project quickly. Unfortunately, there isn't much support for any of that right now, so that will have to come later.

## Some key information

* The tutorial I am using is located [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/lwjglgamedev/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/details).
* This is built against LWJGL 3.0.0 Build 90.
* There is a requirement of OpenGL 3.2 support.

## Main Goals

I'm really just trying to learn how to use OpenGL using LWJGL. I'm in for the ride. I may not do a lot of documentation for now, but when I actually get to creating my final product, I will definitely have that in my intentions.
