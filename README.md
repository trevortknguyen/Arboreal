# Arboreal

This project has some sort of future. It has a vision, just like every other project on GitHub. Yet, like many of the projects on GitHub specifically the LWJGL Java projects on GitHub, this is based on a tutorial and does not actually have any real content yet. I should also mention that it is not playable in any sense yet.

## Some key information

* The tutorial I am using is located [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/lwjglgamedev/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/details).
* This is built against LWJGL 3.0.0.
* There is a requirement of OpenGL 3.2 support.
* This project uses Maven as a build system.

## Main Goals

I'm really just trying to learn how to use OpenGL using LWJGL. I'm in for the ride. I may not do a lot of documentation for now, but when I actually get to creating my final product, I will definitely have that in my intentions.
